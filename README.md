# Rotisserie-MTG
A companion web app for the Rotisserie MTG format

## What Is Rotisserie MTG?

Rotisserie MTG is a fan made turn-based Magic: The Gathering draft format.
- Players draft cards in a snaking fashion (so if there are 6 players drafting, it will go from 1 to 6 and then from 6 to 1, which means the players at the edges get to draft twice in a row).
- Players may draft any card that is legal in the Vintage MTG format.
- There can only be one copy of a card drafted amongst all players (so if Timmy drafted Black Lotus, no one else can).
- Because of that, all drafted cards will be publicly known to all players.
- Players draft until everyone has drafted 35 cards.
- After drafting 35 cards, each player will begin constructing their final decks, adding any number of basic lands to reach a minimum of 40 cards.
- After locking their decks, players will decide on up to 5 cards to act as their "sideboard" to swap between turns, and will not be allowed to change their decks or sideboard after that decision is made.
  - This is done to prevent sideboarding against a specific matchup due to all cards and decks being publicly known.
- The next step is to shuffle up and play!

### In this README I will keep a changelog of the app as it goes along and improves over time

## In Conclusion

A few general thoughts:

I am very happy with the website's front page, with only very few changes I might make to it in the near future in mind. I've hit all the major marks I've wanted to have by the next update and so I believe that it is overall mostly done.


### My Next Move

I think the next move is gonna be as follows:

- Create the About and Contact pages.
- Add mobile design to the Sandbox page
