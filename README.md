# Rotisserie-MTG
A companion web app for the Rotisserie MTG format

## What Is Rotisserie MTG?

Rotisserie MTG is a fan made turn-based Magic: The Gathering draft format.
- Players draft cards in a snaking fashion (so if there are 6 players drafting, it will go from 1 to 6 and then from 6 to 1, which means the players at the edges get to draft twice in a row).
- Players may draft any card that is legal in the Vintage MTG format.
- There can only be one copy of a card drafted amongst all players (so if Timmy drafted Black Lotus, no one else can).
- Because of that, all drafted cards will be publicly known to all players.
- Players draft until everyone has drafted 35 cards.
- After drafting 35 cards, each player will begin constructing their final decks, adding any number of basic lands to reach a minimum of 40 cards.
- After locking their decks, players will decide on up to 5 cards to act as their "sideboard" to swap between turns, and will not be allowed to change their decks or sideboard after that decision is made.
  - This is done to prevent sideboarding against a specific matchup due to all cards and decks being publicly known.
- The next step is to shuffle up and play!

### In this README I will keep a changelog of the app as it goes along and improves over time

# Latest Update:

## _May 11th:_ Draft Carousel and Deployment!
This update focused mainly on turning the draft piles into a carousel and adding some browser support.

This update was a much smaller than the others, though it was definitely a necessary one because it added the last features I wanted to have in the draft page before deploying the website!

The website will be deployed later on today and the address will be added here so you can check it out!

### Update Highlights:

### Draft Piles

- _**NEW**_ Draft piles are now a carousel!
- The Player who's draft pile is being viewed has their name showing at the top left
- Clicking on the 'next' button when viewing the last pile will send the user to the start
- Clicking on the 'back' button when viewing the first pile will send the user to the end

### Miscellaneous Changes

- Floating images of search results now properly appear when the search result is hovered
- Added more browser support
- Fixed a bug where floating card images appeared behind double faced cards
- Fixed a bug where the back side of double faced cards was not visible on Safari


## In Conclusion

So first of all some general thoughts:

I'm really happy with the current state of the website and the fact that the general features of the draft page are complete and ready to be put out there in the world!
However, the website doesn't look good, like, at all. it's all gray and ugly and if you look at it in any smaller screen it doesn't work.

### My Next Move

I have two main things I'd like to do after deployment:

- The first one is going to be the styling and overall look for the draft page. Though I still need come up with the new style for the draft page, this will most definitely be done by the next update. 
- The next thing I'd like to get done after deployment is making the website responsive to different screen sizes. This will most likely take longer and not be ready by the next update because it's something I've never done before, but I think it's relevant and important both that I learn how to do it and so that the website can be viewed and enjoyed by as many people as possible!
