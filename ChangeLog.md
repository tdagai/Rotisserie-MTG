## Apr 28th: App Redesign - Part 1!

<img width="1680" alt="Screen Shot 2021-04-27 at 9 41 58 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7985557/116493230-1c91c800-a853-11eb-8aa6-1b463f94cbe2.png">

In this part of the redesign, I began subdividing the draft page.

### Here is a list of the features that have been added in this update:

#### Top Banner

- Moved the app's title to the top left of the banner
- Moved the search bar to the left side of the banner
- When all text is deleted from the search bar, any search results that were previously shown will disappear
- Reoriented the search results and on-hover images to fit with the search bar's new location
- Added shadow to the search bar on focus to increase focus clarity
- Added shadow to the search results and on-hover images to separate them from anything below them and increase the app's clarity and readability

#### App Body

- Added subdivisions to the app's body to clearly separate the draft pile from the rest of the page and to illustrate the space that will be given to other features

#### Draft Pile(s)

- Draft pile(s) will now be located at the left side of the page
- More work on draft pile(s) to come in future updates

#### Card Display/Preview

- Upon hovering over a drafted card from the draft pile, the card, as well as any relevant information about it, will appear on the left side of the app
- Some data for the displayed card is conditionally rendered since not all cards will share that data
  - (Oracle Text, Flavor Text, P/T, Loyalty)

### My Next Move

My plan for the next update is to incorporate the turn system and the "Stash" (seen at the bottom of the redesign wireframe).
With the Stash, players will be able to search for and save cards even when it's not their turn, and they will be notified when someone drafted a card that's in their Stash. When a player's turn comes around, they'll be able to draft cards straight from their Stash rather than having to search for it.

I really like the Stash because it helps solve to big issues that a turn-based draft format has: long turns and player focus.

By giving players the ability to think ahead of time of what cards they would like to draft and letting them search and save them, turns can go much faster since the oh-so-common situation of a player taking excessively long turns delibirating which cards to draft will be solved before their turn is reached. This also plays into and helps alleviate the second issue of player focus.

During turn-based games, it's easy to lose a player's focus when it's not their turn, and who can blame them? Keeping the players involved even when it's not their turn will allow them not only to stay a few steps ahead in terms of strategy and planning, but will also help them keep track of that strategy and will test their adaptability in case a card they planned to draft was taken from them, thereby keeping them on their toes and invested even when it's not their turn.

By taking these measures, I am hoping to - at least to a degree - address and relieve these problems before they even arise.

## In Conclusion

**All things considered, I am really happy with how the app is turning out so far!**

**More Updates To Come Soon!**

**Teva**
